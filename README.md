# About Me 

I'm a University student that plans on studying Computer Science with a concentration of Cybersecurity and hopefully with a minor in Criminology. 
I'm open to collaborate with others on entry based level projects to help build my portfolio. I'm currently learning Python and plan to learn other languages in the next coming years.
